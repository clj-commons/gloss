(defn string
  "Defines a frame which contains a string.  The charset must be a keyword,
   such as :utf-8 or :ascii.  Available options are :length, :delimiters, :suffix,
   and :char-sequence.

   A string with :length specified is of finite byte length:

   (string :ascii :length 3)

   A string with :delimiters specified is terminated by one or more delimiters:

   (string :utf-8 :delimiters [\"\\r\\n\" \"\\r\"])

   By specifying :value->delimiter you can selectively delimit a value when encoding:

   (string :utf-8 :delimiters [\"\\r\\n\" \" \"] :value->delimiter (fn [v] (if (= v \"END\")  [\"\\r\\n\"] [\" \"])))

   If a string is already bounded in length, but has a terminating sequence, use :suffix

   (string :utf-8, :length 3, :suffix \"\\r\\n\")

   :suffix can be used in conjunction with both :length and :delimiters.  The given :length
   is assumed to not include the suffix, and the delimiters are assumed to be followed by the
   suffix.

   By default, this frame will return a string, but it can be more memory-efficient to
   have it return a java.lang.CharSequence instead.  This frame also will encode CharSequences.
